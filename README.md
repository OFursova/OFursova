ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @OFursova

I am a devoted and knowledge-thirsty software engineer residing in Zaporizhia, Ukraine. With over 5 years of experience, I have been involved in building exceptional software products, primarily focusing on web applications. I have worked as a freelancer, on a contract basis, and more recetly as a part of a fabulous team of Kalyna Solutions.

At the heart of my professional journey is a deep passion for PHP development, backed by significant experience with the Laravel framework. My skills also extend to other programming languages including Javascript, SQL, and Python, reflecting my commitment to versatile development and continuous learning. I'm always on the lookout for new technologies and trends to keep my skills sharp and relevant in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.
